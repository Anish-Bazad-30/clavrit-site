                    Software projects on average run 66 percent over budget and 33 percent over schedule, making it
                    difficult for business executives to manage stakeholder expectations. Project managers rely heavily
                    on project collaboration tools for managing tasks, but find it difficult to track team performance
                    against an accurate project baseline.We created Baseliner.ai to measure and track team performance
                    with an accurate baseline across your project portfolio.Baseliner.ai combines Generative-AI and
                    3-point estimation to establish an accurate project baseline to track team performance to task
                    estimates.
